\section{Variance Stabilizing Method}
Next we do the variance stabilizing step by calling the function \Rfunction{varianceBeadStabilise}. We use the channel "GrnF" as a quality to stabilize, we include only those beads to vst analysis having channelInclude "bgf" equals 1 for a given bead and we produce a new channel channelOutput="vst".
