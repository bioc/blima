\section{Variance Stabilizing Method}
Next we do the variance stabilizing step (based on the model from \cite{lin_model-based_2008} modified for bead level analysis) by calling the function \Rfunction{varianceBeadStabilise}. We use the channel "GrnF" as a quality to stabilize, we include only those beads to vst analysis having channelInclude "bgf" equals 1 for a given bead and we produce a new channel channelOutput="vst".
