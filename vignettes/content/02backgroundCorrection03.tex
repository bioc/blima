There is also function for RMA-like background convolution. Method \Rfunction{xieBacgroundCorrect} do in fact use negative control probes information and is based on non parametric model described in the work \cite{xie_statistical_2009}. To use this model we first have to prepare array addresses of negative control probes in the array. Then we can perform the convolution. If we want to create slot "XIE" processed by the algorithm we call
