\subsection{Working with manufacturer annotation objects}
Illumina annotation in the last subsection provides reanotated data meaning that some data may not match manufacturer annotation. For some applications like submission to Gene Expression Omnibus it should be necesery to work with default manufacturer annotation files. For this purpose is explained in the vignette for \Biocpkg{blimaTestingData} package how to create annotation object called \Robject{annotationHumanHT12V4} which is R representation of text annotation provided by Illumina in file HumanHT-12\_V4\_0\_R2\_15002873\_B.txt available for download from \url{http://support.illumina.com/array/array\_kits/humanht-12\_v4\_expression\_beadchip\_kit/downloads.ilmn}. Provided you have prepared this object you can construct mappings by following way:
