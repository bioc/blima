\section{Introduction}
\Biocpkg{blima} has been created to make a performing bead level analysis of Illumina data possible. It uses the object \Rclass{beadLevelData} from the package \Biocpkg{beadarray} to manipulate with data. It includes several bead level algorithms to support the bead level and a probe level analysis of the data. It utilizes its own method for a background correction, performs variance stabilizing method on the bead level and a bead level quantile normalization. It also provides some basic methods for differential expression testing.

To use this manual and follow examples, please also install the package \Biocpkg{blimaTestingData} and load \Robject{blimatesting} object.
