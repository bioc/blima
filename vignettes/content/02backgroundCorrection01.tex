\section{Background correction}
In the \Biocpkg{blima} package I developed a special approach to the background correction of Illumina microarray data. In this approach there is no background subtraction. Instead we search for the beads for which the background value is out of range of 3 standard deviations from the mean of background values on the chip. We filter out these beads by creating slot with the value 1 for the beads passing background correction and 0 for those beads that do not pass.

Next we create background correction slot called "bgf" in the \Robject{blimatesting} object by calling function \Rfunction{bacgroundCorrect}. We also want to exclude any beads with negative values from the downstream analysis. This is possible by the function \Rfunction{nonPositiveCorrect}. We can create a new slot called "bgfnonnegative" but typically we would like to bitwise add these two channels. This addition is possible by setting parameter channelAndVector of functions \Rfunction{bacgroundCorrect} and \Rfunction{nonPositiveCorrect} to the name of the slot to perform logical and with. Our background correction code reads
