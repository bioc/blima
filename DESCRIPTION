Title: Package for analysis of Illumina microarrays bead level data.
        Package blima includes several bead level algorithms to support
        bead level and probe level analysis of the data. It utilizes
        its own method for background correction, performs variance
        stabilizing method on the bead level and bead level quantile
        normalization. It also provides some basic methods for
        differential expression testing.
